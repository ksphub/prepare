Virtualization vs. Containerization

Virtualization involves creating multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine. Each VM includes a full operating system instance, making them heavier in terms of resource usage.
Containerization (e.g., Docker) involves encapsulating an application and its dependencies into containers. Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight and faster to start compared to VMs.
